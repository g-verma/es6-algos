1.1. Check if a number is power of 10 (i.e.: 1000 it is, 500 is not).
1.2. Find second minimum from a list, without sorting it, time complexity should be O( n )
1.3. First unique character in a string
1.4. Binary search tree, implement PUT and CONTAIN methods (and Order traversal method is slightly wrong,
fix it).
1.5. display how many times a character is repeating in a string
ex: 'aaaabb' => 'a4b2'
'' => ''
'a' => 'a1'
1.6. A product is sold in a time frame. 1->n sellers are offered with a price.
Example:
- Seller 1 has an offer from 1pm to 6pm with a price of 20
- Seller 2 has an offer from 2pm to 5pm with a price of 15
Return a vector with smallest offers in above time slots.
Solution:
- From 1pm to 2pm - price 20
- From 2pm to 5pm - price 15
- From 5pm to 6pm - price 20
