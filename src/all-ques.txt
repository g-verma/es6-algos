13.Count Length of Circle in Array
                 Given a function with 2 parameters - an integer array, and a startIndex
                 Every element of array is greater than or equal to zero
                 Starting from array[startIndex], follow each element the index points to
                 Continue doing this until you find a circle, return the cycle
                 return -1 if no cycle found.

                 Test Case :-  countLengthOfCycle([1,0],0) //output should be 2
                                      countLengthOfCycle([1,2,0],0) //output should be 3

//// 1. Count Length of cycle in Array
// Given a function with 2 parameters - an integer array, and a startIndex
// Every element of array is greater than or equal to zero
// Starting from array[startIndex], follow each element to the index points to
// Continue doing this until you find a cycle, return the cycle
// return -1 if no cycle found.

// Test Case :- countLengthOfCycle([1,0],0) //output should be 2
// countLengthOfCycle([1,2,0],0) //output should be 3
