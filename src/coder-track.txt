13.Count Length of Circle in Array
                 Given a function with 2 parameters - an integer array, and a startIndex
                 Every element of array is greater than or equal to zero
                 Starting from array[startIndex], follow each element the index points to
                 Continue doing this until you find a circle, return the cycle
                 return -1 if no cycle found.

                 Test Case :-  countLengthOfCycle([1,0],0) //output should be 2
                                      countLengthOfCycle([1,2,0],0) //output should be 3

Best Average
testaarr = [['ram','50'],['sham',40'],['ram','50'],['sri',90']]
test result output = 100

ram 10+40+50+50 = 150/4
 = 37.5

sham 40
sri 90
